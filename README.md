# QuantumTeleportation
An illustration of the Concept of Quantum teleportation and its real life simulation


Here Quantum information of a Quantum state of a Qubit is transferred to another Qubit which is present at an infinetly large distance using the concep of Quantum entanglement.

It can be use as a future way of commmunication ; which is fully-hacker proof
